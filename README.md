# Maven Telecom Customer Churn Analysis
## Introduction

Companies rely heavily on customer retention to ensure continued growth and success. However, losing customers, also known as churn, is inevitable in any industry. As a data analyst, my job is to provide an in-depth analysis of Maven Telecom’s churn dataset and to answer the following questions:

- What are the key drivers of churn?
- Is the company losing high value customers? If so, how can they retain them?
- What is the ideal profile of a churned customer?
- What steps can Maven Telecom take to reduce churn?

## Project Strategy
The main steps for this project are:

- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Building the Ideal Churn Profile
- Data Insights
- Customer Retention Strategies
- Data Visualisation

## Insights

- Maven has 1869 churned customers and 20% of them are high-value customers.
- 42% of churned customers only stayed for 6 months or less.
- The top 3 reasons for churn are competitors made better offers, competitors had better devices and attitude of support staff.
- Maven lost ~$1.7 million to competitors, making it the most expensive type of churn
- The key indicators of churn are Month-to-Month contract , No Premium Tech Support, Fiber Optic internet, No promotional offer and Offer E.
- 70% of customers who churned to competitors used Fiber Optic
- High value customers are churning at a rate of 23%
- Based on the key churn indicators, out of 1250 high-value customers remaining, 77% are at high risk of churning.

## Customer Retention Strategies

- Loyalty Programs: Since the top reason for churn is ‘competitors making better offers’ , and more than half of churned customers did not have any promotional offers, Maven could implement different loyalty programs to retain their customers. For instance, they could reward customers on long-term contracts with discounted rates, free upgrade, or additional features. 
- Improve Customer Support: Invest in training and development of support staff to ensure they provide excellent customer service. This could include regular coaching and feedback sessions, as well as incentives for staff who receive positive customer feedback.
- Make better devices: Evaluate the features, performance and pricing of your devices to ensure they are in line with market standards and demand.
- Premium Tech Support: Since customers who did not have access to premium tech support were more likely to churn, Maven should consider offering this service to all customers.
- Improve Fiber Optic Service: Invest in improving your Fiber Optic offerings like faster speeds, more stable connections, and better customer support for Fiber Optic customers.
- Engage High-Value Customers: Prioritise engaging these customers to prevent them from leaving. Provide personalised offers, send targeted communications, and provide premium tech support to ensure these customers remain satisfied with their service.
- After-Sales Service: Schedule regular check-ins with customers to ensure they are still satisfied with their service. These check-ins could be in the form of surveys, phone calls, or email communications.
